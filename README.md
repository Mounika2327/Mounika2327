## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mangaratnam, I am currently an Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering (3rd Year, B.Tech â€“ Aditya University). With a CGPA of 9.16, I am passionate about VLSI Design, Digital Systems, and Protocol Verification. I am fascinated by how millions of devices are integrated into a single chip and how RTL coding & verification methodologies bring them to life.

## ðŸ”¹Technologies Iâ€™m Skilled In:

 â€¢ HDL: Verilog
 â€¢ HVL: SystemVerilog
 â€¢ Verification Methodology: Functional Verification | Testbench Development 
 â€¢ EDA Tools: Xilinx Vivado | Cadence Xcelium 
 â€¢ Domain: VLSI Front-End Design & Verification 
 â€¢ Protocols: UART, SPI, I2C, APB, AXI (Currently learning PCIe)
 â€¢ Programming Languages: C, Python
 â€¢ Core Skills: RTL Coding | Testbench Writing in SystemVerilog | Digital Circuit Design 

## ðŸ”¹ Other Skills:
MATLAB || PSpice  || Git & GitHub || Microsoft Office

## ðŸ“‚ Projects:

### â€¢  **APB Protocol Interfacing** 
 â€“ Designed & verified APB protocol with 1 master and 3 slaves; developed SystemVerilog testbenches and verified slave states (Hold, Setup, Active).
###  â€¢ **AXI to APB Bridge** 
 â€“ Implemented and verified a bridge for communication between AXI & APB protocols.
### â€¢ **AHB to APB Bridge** 
 â€“ Implemented and verified a bridge for communication between AHB & APB protocols.

## ðŸ“œ Certifications:

- **Cisco**
  â€“ C Programming Language
